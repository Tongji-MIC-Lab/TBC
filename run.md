# TBC

### Usage
The TBC feature is an efficient descriptor for human action recognition. In order to compile the code of TBC, the OpenCV library has to be installed in your system. The TBC feature can be calculated along different tracking algorithms, e.g. dense trajectories (available from http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/dense_trajectories) and improved dense trajectories (available from http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/improved_trajectories). There are only two public interfaces of TBC, so it is easy to use the code with different tracking algorithms. If you find bugs of the program, feel free to drop me a line.
